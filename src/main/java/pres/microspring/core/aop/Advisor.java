/**
 * Base interface holding AOP <b>advice</b> (action to take at a joinpoint)
 * and a filter determining the applicability of the advice (such as
 * a pointcut). <i>This interface is not for use by Spring users, but to
 * allow for commonality in support for different types of advice.</i>
 *
 * <p>Spring AOP is based around <b>around advice</b> delivered via method
 * <b>interception</b>, compliant with the AOP Alliance interception API.
 * The Advisor interface allows support for different types of advice,
 * such as <b>before</b> and <b>after</b> advice, which need not be
 * implemented using interception.
